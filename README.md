# If you want to setup SDL2 from scratch

### Setting up SDL2 on Windows:

1. Download the "SDL2-devel-2.30.6-mingw.tar.gz" from [here](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/releases/tag/release-2.30.6).
2. Extract the files and copy the all header files from "x86_64-w64-mingw32/include/SDL2" folder to a new folder named "sdl" and move that folder to the project's include directory which I have already provided in the repository.
3. Copy the lib folder from the "x86_64-w64-mingw32" folder to the project directory as it is.
4. Now for the DLL files, copy the dll files present in "x86_64-w64-mingw32/bin" and paste them in the project directory (dont create new folder for these).
5. Do the same for: [SDL_image](https://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_image/release/SDL2_image-devel-2.8.2-mingw.tar.gz) ,
[SDL_ttf](https://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_ttf/release/SDL2_ttf-devel-2.22.0-mingw.tar.gz) ,
[SDL_Mixer](https://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_mixer/release/SDL2_mixer-devel-2.8.0-mingw.tar.gz).
    
6. Compile the project using the provided `MakeFile` or edit it according to your requirements.
7. Run the `Main.exe` using `./main`.
